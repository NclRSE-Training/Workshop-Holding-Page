# Workshop-Holding-Page
A page for planned Carpentries Workshops when the workshop website is not yet available

### Why?
It takes time to allocate instructors and set up a webpage for each workshop.   
It is best to not set up workshop websites too far in advance as sites based on out of date templates won't rebuild after a change.
